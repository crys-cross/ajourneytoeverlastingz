		&emsp; Even if we just knew each other for about three weeks, we often get to talk each other through phone every after work and I even get to visit you at the coffee shop whenever I'm nearby. We became pretty much close even if we often just talk through phone. I found out that you already saw me the week before we met. You were already looking at me whenever I passed by and you thought to yourself that time that I was cute. We mutually agreed that years after that maybe love at first sight do happen. Off coarse ever since we started chatting, you always ask if there was no person who would get mad at our being close. For short you’re implying that I have a girlfriend from my home town. I explained carefully that I did have a M.U.(Mutual Understanding) friend at my home town but it was nothing serious at that time. Although doubtful at first, you took my word for it and eventually we became something like a M.U. One day while talking with you through phone, you started calling me <mark><q>Coal ko(mine)</q></mark>. I was surprised and asked her why. She explained that I was her friend, I was her coal. I replied with <mark><q>ah?ganon ba Amber ko?wait I think I’ll start rolling here in bed for a while</q></mark>. Then you asked "kinikilig ka? I replied with <mark><q>Probably not, but I can't stop smiling thinking of you</q></mark>. You replied that it was ok since you were also unable to stop smiling while also rolling in your bed. And so to maximize the opportunity I joked around that you should give me a kiss even through the phone. You agreed but only if we kissed at the same time. And so you went and said <mark><q>One...two..three..muah!</q></mark>. Very korny but it works. We ended our call since you already needed to go to work. And so from that day forward we called each other’s name with the word <mark><q>KO</q></mark> after our names most probably as a sign of ownership even if we were not yet official.

   		&emsp; A few more days passed you finally agreed to visit me at my home. Since it was cheaper to date at home plus I was often lazy after a busy work week. You arrived at around 9am and I fetched you from the highway and left you at my home for a while as I bought some eggs and instant pansit canton since I promised to cook for you. We sat at the table as some light shines your cute brown eyes as I stared at you nonstop as we were talking about anything. I couldn't remember the time I was not staring at you. As we had nothing much to talk about you brought out your USB filled with love songs. We plugged it in my housemates DVD player and you tried to lip sing or sing some love songs while looking at me as if you’re dedicating the played song for me. We eventually stopped the songs and decided to just play some Family Computer games built in the dvd player. I placed a foam in front of the T.V. and we sat there as we played. We sat about half a meter apart as I slowly minimize the gap between us. Eventually our shoulders were touching each other. I placed my head at your shoulder to rest it. You told me <mark><q>parang ang sikip ah?</q></mark>. I replied with <mark><q>syempre, close friends tayo, literally</q></mark>. And den I hugged you while you were stiffed and I believe you were surprised. You said <mark><q>hoy friends lng tayo ah?</q></mark>. I said <mark><q>yeah, so?</q></mark> while still hugging you. You removed my arms around you then you placed both your hands at my cheeks and pulled my face in front of your face touching our foreheads to each other. While looking at your eyes at the closest position ever you started blabing <mark><q>tayo...friends lang tayo!</q></mark>. As you were saying those words I felt as if time was on super slow motion. Your face is just infront of me and many thoughts were raising my mind. Right after you finished saying <mark><q>tayo...friends lang tayo!</q></mark>, I immediately pushed my head forward touching our lips together to kiss you. I was expecting you to remove it right away but it was as if time stood still and you instantly closed your eyes and moved your lips to kiss back. At about three seconds you came to your senses and pulled yourself backwards and tried to slap me but it was so weak as if you just placed your hands at my face and pushed it. You were hysterical and confused and asked <mark><q>hala!bat mo yun ginawa?</q></mark>. I just answered <mark><q>kasi, I like you...a lot</q></mark>. And you continued by asking me why I wasn't courting you. I told you that it was already obvious since for the past few weeks I have been trying so much to be close to you. You continued mumbling being confused asking yourself what to do for the next few minutes until you asked me what day was that day. I told you that it was the 16th of the month. Then you told me <mark><q>Alalahanin mo ang araw na toh ah?kc eto ang araw na sinagot na kita. I love you</q></mark>. I was surprised yet I hugged you and told you that I love you. You insisted that I you were the one who said it first so I should use too in which I did. We were quite happy that time but I need to go since it was already 11am and I still had a flight to Cebu since I will have a seminar training there. Together we went to town. We were already holding each other's hands while walking. We bought some snacks at Greenwich and I accompanied you home since your home was on the same way going to Butuan Airport.

		&emsp; Upon my arrival at the airport I was already very late. The front desk called the plane if they could still accept a passenger. Thankfully they still could. With some crew that helped me with my bags, we rushed to the plane. Upon getting in the plane and sitting down, the plane took off. Other passengers were confused if I was a VIP or something like that since the plane waited for me. A bit embarrassing but at least I was not left by the plane and made it to Cebu on time. Upon my arrival at Cebu airport I received a call from my ex and answered it and heard her say <mark><q>Hi beh kamusta ka na?</q></mark>. And then it hit me that the night before she called crying asking if we could still fix what we had previously although it was more than a month since we broke up. We broke up before I even met Amber. Anyway I was so tired the night before that I accidentally said yes so that the conversation would end and I could get some sleep. So after realizing what did happen the night before, I thought of finally telling her that I already love someone else but I don't know how to say it. I told her that I just arrived Cebu and I was already on the way to my hotel. She said <mark><q>Ah ok beh, you take care I...ahm basta call lang if d ka busy</q></mark>. I just said yes but we both knew that it was a bit awkward so we dropped the call right away eventually. I was already in a dilemma on what to do. My ex still hurting and I don't know how to end it with her as I was already committed to my new love. Thankfully that night during company dinner, I received a text from my ex that she could feel that it was already different and she will set me free and well see from there if we could be friends or not in which I agreed.  With mixed emotions since hurting someone is never good but at least that was the end of my problem. The next day I and my coworkers went to Sto. Nino church and I lit some candles there. My prayers were for my family then for my ex hoping she could find someone who is truly for her. Eventually a week after that she had a boyfriend and it continued to another boyfriend until after a year she became pregnant and married her boyfriend at that time so I knew that it was an answered prayer and she’s doing ok to this current day. Lastly my prayer was for my new love in which we would have wonderful years together and hopefully she could be permitted to be with my future onwards. Every prayer is answered in what is best for us I believe. And we did spent wonderful years after that. That church was special for me and that I always remember you whenever I get to visit that place over the years. Why? Since it already became a symbol of how blessed I am to have you.
