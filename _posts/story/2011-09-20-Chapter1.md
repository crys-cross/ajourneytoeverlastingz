   	<p>&emsp; It was a boring morning as I went to work and my first stop was the pharmacy beside the coffeehouse/bakery where I usually conduct my coordination meetings with my Medrep counterparts. As I was trying to gain more sales with the pharmacist we ended up just talking about anything just when a customer came in. A girl which the pharmacist knows that she introduced me to her but i was uninterested since my mind was all about hitting my monthly sales objective but she was kinda cute though but still im unfazed. And so after a few seconds being served, the girl left and I continued to ask for sales again just when another customer came in. I thought it was another bother again but I decided to look at the door which was behind me just to see who it was and hope that the person will go out right away. But to my surprise there was a cute girl standing at the door with fair complexion, brilliant smile, and big brown eyes looking straight at me with a bit of shock but still with an adorable expression. Although only for a split second, I felt as if time stood still while we were looking at each other but then I noticed her moving towards the counter and I remembered that I was at work and the pharmacist was saying something. The pharmacist and the girl knew each other and the pharmacist was actually introducing me to the girl saying that I was single and that the girl's name was Amber. I was about to say something just to get to know her better but she quickly said <mark><q>Hinde ba taga Getz ka?</q></mark>. And deep inside my mind I started thinking <q>WTF, the girl knows me, does she like me?</q>.  And so our first conversation with smiles started and you ordered your canned juice and you quickly left jokingly saying <mark><q>Alis na ako, baka bigla pa ako mgkaroon ng boyfriend</q></mark>. I was instantly drawn to you for some strange reason. The pharmacist told me that you were working at the coffeeshop/bakery beside the pharmacy. I instantly went out of the pharmacy hoping to see you at the coffeehouse counter but unfortunately you were not there.

	<p>&emsp; Later that day I met up with my roommate who was a Medrep and told him that I met somebody who I was fascinated at. He then immediately turned the car and went back to the coffeehouse in hopes of meeting you again. Upon our arrival you were at the cashier smiling at me as I walk towards the counter. I started the conversation with <mark><q>ano masarap dito?</q></mark>. And you answered <mark><q>ako</q></mark>. I bursted in laughter and said <mark><q>un nakakain naman din</q></mark> and you again blurted out <mark><q>ako nga</q></mark>. But you latered showed me some the overpriced ensaymada and I bught it in a heartbeat. My main plan was to make an impression(mgpa cute) until we can become friends but my roommate thinks otherwise and told her to write her number at the back of the reciept in which she smiled and wrote it. I was surprised and over joyed. It was a SMART Telco number. I was a TM Globe Telco subscriber and so I got to text you the day after with the most commonly used(super gasgas) one liner flirtitous text <mark><q>Hi po kamusta?</q></mark>. You replied the day after that day with a Globe Telco number. After about a week of few flirt texts here and flirt calls there, you finally agreed to meet for a date at your day off from work. We decided to meet lunchtime at Butuan Plaza. I was not excited but for some reason I was almost an hour early and I sat there waiting for you. Five minutes after our set time, I recieved a text message from you.
